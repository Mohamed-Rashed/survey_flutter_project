<h2>8. How does the Panel work?</h2>
Panelists will receive survey invitations by email SMS or other electronic communication from Marketeers with links leading to surveys. There is no obligation for you to answer surveys. Each survey is only to be answered once. If you decide you are not interested to take part in a specific survey, you can always click on the survey’s "no reminders" link at the bottom of the invitation email. This means that you will not receive reminders for that specific survey, but you will still receive other survey invitations. Please do not mark emails from Marketeers Panel as spam, as explained in the previous section. Marketeers is not bound to send surveys to all Panelists for each new survey; nor can Marketeers guarantee either a minimal or a maximal number of surveys that are sent out per year.
Marketeers has taken high data safety measures. Still, should any viruses appear in the emails sent to you, Marketeers is not liable for the consequences that such cases may entail and thus no compensation may be claimed from Marketeers for such reasons.
Our Panelists cannot participate in surveys outside of their countries of registration. If you move to another country, you will need to cancel your membership and register again in the new country. We will transfer your points to the new account.
